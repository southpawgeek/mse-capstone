# Capstone - Master of Software Engineering
## January 13th, 2021 - March 23rd, 2021

This was a 10-week course. Our assignment was to create a Library Management System. Users would be able to log in and reserve books. Librarians would log in to add new titles, and manage copies of books.

The group assignment was meant for 4-6 students. Due to low enrollment, it was only me and one other student. Because of this, we had to manage expectations regarding which features would be implemented. Some features were pushed to a theoretical future sprint. This was presented to the instructor along with the final application.
